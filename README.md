# School Data

A (prototype) full stack application for use with parents/students/teachers to aid the understanding of a students' academic progress. The plan for this is to use Wonde's api for access to schools MIS data.

## Stack

- React
- Node
- Express
- MongoDB

### Also uses

- Google Oauth for staff/students
- Standard username/password for parents
- Cookies storing jwt for user session
- charjs for graphs
- Redux
- axios for requests
- Currently uses Bootstrap (badly) for UI
